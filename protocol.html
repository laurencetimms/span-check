    <h1>Span Check — Protocol</h1>

    <p class="subtitle">Small, infrequent instructions that reveal the narrowing of mental and physical range.</p>

    <p>Span Check exists to counter the quiet narrowing of mental and physical range that occurs over time. It does this by introducing occasional, unfamiliar demands and otherwise remaining silent. It is not a programme, a practice, or a training system.</p>

    <p>Span Check does not optimise performance, track progress, or assess capability. It assumes the user is already broadly competent. Its purpose is not improvement, but preservation of range.</p>

    <p>On some days, a single instruction is issued. On other days, nothing is issued. Silence is intentional and carries no meaning.</p>

    <p>Each instruction is deliberately small. It should require no preparation, equipment, warm-up, or recovery. If an instruction feels impressive, effortful, or like training, it is being misread. Instructions are unfamiliar by structure, not by difficulty. Unfamiliarity is introduced by varying one of three things: the capability engaged, the context in which it is engaged, or its orientation relative to defaults. No instruction is intended to be repeated deliberately. Accidental repetition is inconsequential.</p>

    <p>Span Check does not build habits. It does not escalate. It does not adapt. It does not remember what has been done, and it does not care whether an instruction is completed. Missing an instruction has no consequence. Ignoring one has no consequence. Extended silence indicates nothing.</p>

    <p>Explanations, when present, describe structural reasoning only. They do not describe benefit or outcome.</p>

    <p>Span Check will not reassure, warn, motivate, evaluate, or summarise.</p>

    <p>If motivation, feedback, progression, or proof of improvement is required, Span Check is not suitable.</p>

    <p>Span Check is consulted, not followed. It is complete even when it does nothing.</p>
